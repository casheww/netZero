# netZero
Concept code for an organisation-oriented system rewarding points for lowering your carbon footprint. For the AstraZeneca Hackathon 2020 (Team 001).

Our code handles only backend operations of a database that stores organisation and user data based on the above concept. The run down of the rest of our project is in the submitted video.

### Quick Links
The bulk of the code (the database controller) is located at [`db/interface.py`](https://github.com/casheww/netZero/blob/main/db/interface.py), and [`demo.py`](https://github.com/casheww/netZero/blob/main/demo.py) utilises these functions for the sake of the submitted video.
The SQL used to create the database tables can be found [here](https://github.com/casheww/netZero/blob/main/db/sqlite-database-setup.sql).
